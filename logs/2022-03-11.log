***************************
APPLICATION FAILED TO START

Description:

The dependencies of some of the beans in the application context form a cycle:

┌─────┐
|  dataSource defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/jdbc/DataSourceConfiguration$Hikari.class]
↑     ↓
|  org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceInitializerInvoker
└─────┘


Action:

Relying upon circular references is discouraged and they are prohibited by default. Update your application to remove the dependency cycle between beans. As a last resort, it may be possible to break the cycle automatically by setting spring.main.allow-circular-references to true.
